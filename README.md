# 🧠 Brain Tumor detection Based on MRI Images

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning models.  
It compares **CNN**, **ResNet50**, and **InceptionV3**, along with 2 **custom optimized models** designed for improved accuracy on preprocessed MRI images.

### 🔍 Features
- Image preprocessing framework for noise reduction and enhancement  
- Model comparison on noised vs. preprocessed MRI datasets  
- Evaluation using **PSNR**, **SSIM**, **Accuracy**, **Precision**, and **Recall**  

### 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Google Colab, Kaggle  


### 📊 Results
Preprocessing improved image quality and model performance significantly,  
achieving higher PSNR/SSIM and accuracy in tumor classification.
